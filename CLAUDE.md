# RUNI Market – Project Overview

## What Is This?
RUNI Market is a campus marketplace web application built exclusively for Reichman University students in Herzliya, Israel. Students buy and sell second-hand items within the university community; all transactions happen in person on campus — no payment processing. Anyone can browse listings without an account, but posting, messaging and watchlisting require a verified university account.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript (strict mode ON) + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui component library
- **Backend**: Supabase (via Lovable Cloud) — PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime
- **State**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v6
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Tests**: Vitest (`npx vitest run`); typecheck with `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit`

## Development Workflow (IMPORTANT)
- Lovable deploys **`main`**. Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are applied to the live DB on deploy.
- Established convention in this project: develop on the designated `claude/*` working branch, commit, push, then **merge into `main` and push main** so the user sees changes in Lovable (the user has explicitly approved this flow).
- Always run typecheck + build + tests before pushing.
- The Supabase types file `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` is normally generated; when a migration adds tables/functions, manually add matching types (done for watchlist, reports, user_roles, watch_count, is_admin, delete_own_account).

## Internationalization (EN/HE)
- Custom lightweight i18n in `src/i18n/` — `translations.ts` (flat key dictionaries `en`/`he`, typed so missing Hebrew keys fail compile) and `LanguageContext.tsx` (`useLanguage()` → `lang`, `setLang`, `t`, `tCategory`, `tCondition`). Persisted in localStorage.
- Hebrew switches the whole document to RTL (`dir` on `<html>`); use `rtl:` Tailwind variants for directional fixes; `ArrowRight/ArrowLeft` icons get `rtl:rotate-180`.
- Brand name: "RUNI Market" in English, **"רייכמן מרקט"** in Hebrew. Logo (star crescent) must stay LEFT of the brand text even in RTL (logo `<Link>` has `dir="ltr"`).
- Category/condition values are stored in English in the DB; `tCategory`/`tCondition` translate for display only.
- date-fns with `he` locale for relative times when Hebrew.
- A test (`src/test/i18n.test.ts`) enforces en/he key parity.

## Design System
- **Primary color**: HSL(226, 81%, 33%) — Reichman blue, RGB(16, 44, 151)
- **RUNI Market Navbar**: blue (`bg-primary`) with inverted (white) text/buttons; white search bar row below (eBay style); blue footer — blue frame around white content.
- **RUNI Tickets Navbar/Footer**: red (`bg-red-700`) with white text/buttons; red-tinted sub-bar with quick links; shows "RUNI Tickets" branding. Uses `TicketsNavbar` + `TicketsLayout` components and `Footer variant="tickets"` (separate from the main `Navbar`/`Layout`).
- **Logo**: `src/assets/reichman-stars.png` — white star crescent on transparent background (extracted programmatically from the official wordmark; the bottom star group was repositioned to close the gap where the wordmark text sat). Blends seamlessly into the blue bar. On Tickets navbar the same PNG is shown with `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)` to stay white on red.
- Mobile-first; mobile nav is a Sheet (hamburger).

## Pages & Routes (src/pages/)
| Route | Page | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Index — compact hero, 3 info cards, Recent Listings (8 newest) | public |
| `/browse` | Browse — search (reads `?search=` from navbar, 300ms debounce), category/condition/price filters, sort (newest/price asc/desc), pagination (24 + Load more) | public |
| `/tickets` | Tickets — red-themed event overview grid (date, venue, offer count, lowest price); uses `TicketsLayout` | public |
| `/tickets/:id` | TicketEvent — event detail + StockX-style market view (lowest ask, highest bid), public offers and public bids; viewing is public, placing bids/selling tickets requires login | public view; actions require auth |
| `/listing/:id` | ListingDetail — gallery w/ thumbnails, badges, watch heart, watch count, posted-by (links to seller), Contact Seller (hidden when sold), Report dialog, Edit button for owner | public |
| `/listing/:id/edit` | EditListing — fields + photo add/remove (instant) | owner |
| `/sell` | Sell — create listing (zod, ≤3 photos) | protected |
| `/my-listings` | MyListings — status badge, Mark as Sold/Relist, Edit, Delete (confirm) | protected |
| `/watchlist` | Watchlist — saved listings grid | protected |
| `/seller/:id` | SellerProfile — avatar initial, member since, active listings; own profile: inline name edit (syncs profiles + auth metadata), Delete account | public |
| `/messages` | Messages — `?c=<id>` selects conversation (survives reloads; do NOT use router state, it gets lost in the Lovable preview). Viewport-pinned layout (`<Layout fullHeight>`): no page scroll, no footer; sidebar and thread scroll independently. Chat header: listing photo + title + price (links to listing), person name in gray below | protected |
| `/admin/reports` | AdminReports — open reports w/ dismiss + delete-listing | admin |
| `/login`, `/signup` | Auth pages | public |

## Key Components & Hooks
- `Layout` (`fullHeight` prop pins to viewport, hides footer), `Navbar` (lang toggle EN/עברית, unread badge on Messages — realtime, admin Reports link, user name links to own profile), `Footer` (`variant="market" | "tickets"`; no logo; tickets variant is red with RUNI Tickets copy).
- `TicketsLayout` + `TicketsNavbar` — red-themed layout for all `/tickets/*` routes; brand shows "RUNI Tickets"; no search bar (events are browsed, not searched); layout renders `Footer variant="tickets"`.
- `ListingCard`: image, heart toggle (top corner, hidden on own listings), title, price ₪, badges, relative upload time + watch count.
- `hooks/useListings.ts`: `useListings(filters{search,category,condition,priceMin/Max,sort,limit})`, `useListing(id)`, `useMyListings`, `useCreateListing`, `useUpdateListing`, `useSetListingStatus`, `useDeleteListing` (also removes storage files), `useAddListingImages`, `useDeleteListingImage`. Shared `uploadListingImages` compresses via `lib/image.ts` (max 1200px, JPEG 80%).
- `hooks/useMessages.ts`: `useConversations` (single batched messages query → latest_message + unread_count per convo), `useMessages` (realtime INSERT subscription), `useUnreadCount` (global badge, realtime), `useMarkConversationRead` (marks incoming read when chat open), `useSendMessage`, `useCreateConversation` (dedupes existing).
- `hooks/useWatchlist.ts`: `useWatchlistIds` (Set for heart state), `useWatchlist`, `useToggleWatchlist` (invalidates listing queries — watch_count lives on listings).
- `hooks/useReports.ts`: `useIsAdmin`, `useReports`, `useSubmitReport`, `useDismissReport`.
- `hooks/useAuth.tsx`: signUp restricted to `@post.runi.ac.il` (normalized lowercase), signIn refuses unverified emails (defense in depth).
- ChatWindow scrolls only its own list (`scrollTop`), never `scrollIntoView` (that scrolled the whole page).

## Database (supabase/migrations/ — chronological)
Tables: `profiles`, `listings` (+`watch_count`), `listing_images`, `conversations`, `messages`, `watchlist`, `reports`, `user_roles`.

Key server-side rules (all enforced by migrations, not just frontend):
- **Signup domain**: trigger on `auth.users` rejects non-`@post.runi.ac.il` emails (insert + email change).
- **Public read**: active listings, their images, and profiles of active sellers are readable by anon; sellers/conversation participants/admins see more. Writes require auth.
- **Validation CHECKs**: message 1–2000 chars; listing title ≤100, description ≤2000, price 0–1,000,000; profile name ≤100.
- **Message integrity**: trigger freezes content/sender/conversation/created_at on UPDATE; `is_read` can only go false→true.
- **watch_count**: maintained by triggers on watchlist insert/delete.
- **Limits**: max 20 active listings/user, max 3 images/listing (triggers).
- **Roles**: `user_roles` has no client write policies (no self-promotion); `is_admin(uid)` SECURITY DEFINER. Seed admin: `ariel.wyrobnik@post.runi.ac.il`. Admins can SELECT/DELETE any listing and read/delete reports.
- **Account deletion**: `delete_own_account()` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER, deletes own auth.users row, cascades).
- **Storage**: `listing-images` public bucket; per-user folder (`<uid>/...`) for insert/update/delete; bucket-wide listing/enumeration policy removed; trigger functions' EXECUTE revoked from client roles; GraphQL endpoint revoked.
- **Storage cleanup**: AFTER DELETE trigger `delete_listing_image_object` on `listing_images` (SECURITY DEFINER) removes the matching `storage.objects` row whenever an image row is deleted — covers admin deletes and account-deletion cascades where the owner-folder RLS policy blocks the client `remove()`. Idempotent with the eager client-side removal in `useDeleteListing`/`useDeleteListingImage`.
- Realtime publication includes `messages` (RLS-filtered delivery).

## Security Status
Lovable security scan addressed (see migrations `*_security_hardening.sql`, `*_public_read_listings.sql`). Remaining accepted/manual items:
- **Leaked password protection**: Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Attack Protection (likely Pro-plan only; org is on Free tier — accepted).
- Realtime "any user can subscribe" finding = false positive (postgres_changes respects RLS).
- Raw Supabase error messages shown in toasts (accepted for now).
- "Confirm email" is ON in the Supabase dashboard (required — signIn also checks client-side).

## RUNI Tickets (separate sub-product, red theme)
Ticket exchange for RUNI campus events — distinct visual identity (red) from the blue marketplace.
- **Data layer scaffold** (`src/data/ticketEvents.ts`, `src/hooks/useTicketEvents.ts`): typed static data today with admin-curated events, seller offers, and public buyer bids; designed to swap 1:1 to Supabase `events`, `ticket_offers`, and `ticket_bids` tables without UI changes.
- **Events are admin-curated** — no user-created events; new events added by editing `ticketEvents.ts` (scaffold) or via future admin UI. Ticket offers and bids currently live in the static scaffold; no persistent ticket writes exist yet.
- **Market view** (`src/pages/TicketEvent.tsx`): shows lowest ask, highest bid, sorted public sell offers, and sorted public buy bids. Signed-in users can add a local/public bid in the scaffold UI; anonymous visitors see read-only market data plus login/signup CTA. Bids use the authenticated user's `full_name`/email, not a free-text buyer name. Future ticket-selling UI must be auth-gated too.
- **Next steps not yet built**: separate `events`/`ticket_offers`/`ticket_bids` DB tables + migrations, Admin event management UI, persistent ticket-posting/bid flows for students.
- `src/lib/email.ts` (pure email helpers) and `src/lib/conversations.ts` (pure aggregation) are testable pure functions extracted from hooks.

## Known Open Items / Next Ideas
- **Email notifications for new messages** — deliberately not built: needs an external provider (e.g. Resend) API key + Supabase Edge Function. User would need to create the account first.
- No reviews/ratings. Marketplace item offers/bidding remain intentionally out of scope; RUNI Tickets now has a scaffolded public bid/ask market view only.
- ~16 unit tests (email domain rule in `src/lib/email.ts`, conversation aggregation in `src/lib/conversations.ts`, i18n parity, storage path helper); no E2E yet.

## Constraints
- English + Hebrew interface (full parity enforced by test)
- No payment processing
- Email restricted to `@post.runi.ac.il`
- Max 3 photos per listing (DB-enforced)
- Student-run side project — not an official university initiative
